#summary A very little guide to discover Windows CE development on the mini2440 board

Running Windows CE 6.0 on mini2440 is not very hard. You just have to download the BSP of the board, install software develoment tools (free evaluation version available on the Microsoft website), generate a Windows CE image and flash it in the board.
When Windows CE runs on the mini2440, it is then possible to develop Windows CE appplications using Visual Studio 2005 pro.

The following links will guide you through all these stages, from the generation of the Windows CE image to a first application development : <br>
